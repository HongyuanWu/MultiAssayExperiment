biocExperimentHub
=================

This repo is intended to start the Bioconductor special interest group
on mergeable experiment collections like TCGA.  Our objective is to use R/Bioconductor
to define interfaces allowing efficient selection and combination of 
high-dimensional assays obtained on all or many members of a group of
samples or patients.
